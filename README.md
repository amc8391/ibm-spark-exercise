Spark Exercise

As this is a very early version of this solver, there are no command line arguments accepted. To process different filesets, one can change the PUZZLE_PATHS and FREQ_DICT variables in the main.py program
In order to start the Spark anagram solver, be sure to install all necessary requirements using the requirements.txt file provided
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

From there, the program should be ready to go; it can be started by running `python main.py`

Notably, I am using Python v3.7.0 with a virtual env on a Windows 10 computer. Hopefully these things shouldn't matter in running the code, but you never know.
